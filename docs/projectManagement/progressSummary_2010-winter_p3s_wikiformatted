=== 3/15/2010 (Week 20) ===

'''Progress:''' An early prototype of the main user interface was developed and for presentations. We also met with our client and demoed it for her. (for more details, see our project change log: http://trac.osuosl.org/trac/rapidgraph/timeline)

'''Problems:''' Progress was slower than we wanted this week due to dead week activities.

'''Plans:''' Since this is the last P3 of the term, we'll include plans for over spring break: Our goal is to have a functional user interface and a working API by the beginning of next term so we can start to do some major development with the plugins along side development of a more advanced UI.

=== 3/1/2010 (Week 18) ===

'''Progress:''' All of the work that was done this week can be found in the timeline of our project management software: 
http://trac.osuosl.org/trac/rapidgraph/timeline?from=03/01/10&daysback=7&ticket=on&changeset=on&milestone=on&wiki=on&update=Update The fact that we got [the application] up and running was also a bit accomplishment :)

'''Problems:''' None! A lot of progress was made this week.

'''Plans:''' Continue to work on the javascript models for the main application.


=== 2/21/2010 (Week 17) ===

'''Progress:''' A successful "Hello world!" was produced by the framework. More work was done on the project site, including adding a new plugin implementation page (not yet live)

'''Problems:''' Still trying to figure out exactly how all of the components will fit together.

'''Plans:''' Implement the core application and get the graph object written.


=== 2/15/2010 (Week 16) ===

'''Progress:''' Much progress was made this week. The Django framework was put into place, and a plugin system design was thought out. More design work went into the the core API.

'''Problems:''' None.

'''Plans:''' Plan to further implement the Django framework and start implementing the core UI.


=== 2/8/2010 (Week 15) ===

'''Progress:''' Began work on the Django framework. Got in contact with someone to help with the UI layout.

'''Problems:''' It was a lot of work to wrestle with Django to get it to recognize plugins within Python packages.

'''Plans:''' To do more work on the Django framework.


=== 2/1/2010 (Week 14) ===

'''Progress:''' We've made more progress on the UI design work and successfully made contact with the owner of LucidChart.com who said we cannot, in fact, view the source code, but he did offer some very helpful hints.

'''Problems:''' None this week.

'''Plans:''' We plan on finishing the UI design work, and finishing the API.


=== 1/25/2010 (Week 13) ===

'''Progress:''' Worked more on the API, worked more on the front-end design, updated project site, completed presentation.

'''Problems:''' This was a busy week, so not as much got done as we would have liked.

'''Plans:''' Finish the API, finish prelimiary front-end design, begin back-end design.


=== 1/17/2010 (Week 12) ===

'''Progress:''' Emailed LucidChart regarding obtaining documented and formatted source code for UI research purposes. Updated project site with new logo and project links section (http://trac.osuosl.org/trac/rapidgraph/wiki). Updated API. Git repo'd the project site files for backup. Started serious UI design work.

'''Problems:''' None this week!

'''Plans:''' Finish UI design work. Finish UI API. Contact LucidChart (see "progress" section). Prepare for presentation on Thursday.


=== 1/11/2010 (Week 11) ===

'''Progress:''' We made some more progress on hashing out the design for our main front-end, using some existing web-apps as inspiration. Also started talking about our presentation.

'''Problems:''' None to report yet this term!

'''Plans:''' We plan on finishing up or presentations early next week (before class on Tuesday) and also finishing up our main API by the end of the week.


=== 12/6/2009 (Week 10) ===

'''Progress:'''
 * Put finishing touches on our poster and TRIP documents.
 * Further developed specifics for the API for our core system.
 * Unsuccessfully attempted to contact our sponsor.
 * Brainstormed ideas for updating our project site.

'''Problems:''' We were very busy with end-of-term projects, and we didn't get as much done as we might have liked.

'''Plans:''' We plan to begin the implementation and coding of our core system during this coming winter break.


=== 11/23/2009 (Week 08) ===

'''Progress:''' Unfortunately neither one of us was able to make much progress this week on our project, due to a heavy homework load and other commitments

'''Problems:''' No blockers or other problems to speak of.

'''Plans:'''
 * To finish our technology review document
 * Flush our the requirements for our API

=== 11/16/2009 (Week 07) ===

'''Progress:'''
 * Set up Trac and Wiki website instance
 * Created a visual logo for our project
 * Began to create rough specifications for our core backendAPI

'''Problems:''' None really ... things are rapidly moving forward

'''Plans:'''
 * Finish drawing out specifications for our the backend ofour API
 * Begin coding backend API
 * Touch bases with our sponsor to get her official approval
 * Begin technology research


=== 11/9/2009 (Week 06) ===

'''Progress:''' 
 * Met with Soroush and showed him our progress with the requirements document and the Gantt chart. He gave us suggestions on how to complete them.
 * Significant progress made on the requirements document which is nearing completion.
 * Finished the Gantt chart per the suggestions of Soroush.

'''Problems:''' We're still waiting on our Trac instance at the OSL.

'''Plans:''' 
 * Meet with Mrs. Wallace to discuss our progress and requirements document.
 * Finish the requirements document. All that's left is the dataflow diagram and any changes Mrs. Wallace requests to be made.
 * Email Rudy at the OSL regarding our Trac instance.


=== 11/2/2009 (Week 05) ===

'''Progress:'''
 * Spoke with our TA regarding the direction of our project.
 * Trac and Git hosting at the OSL is in-progress.
 * Progress was made on the Gantt chart for our requirements document.
 * Briefly touched bases with our sponsor regarding the progress of our requirements document.

'''Problems:''' Trac and Git hosting was not completed this week, which is hindering progress specifically regarding porting our requirements document to our "living" project page.

'''Plans:''' 
 * Again, get hosting set up. We'll need to bug them some more to get going on this.
 * Finish the Gantt chart.
 * Finish the requirements document.
 * Begin porting the requirements document to Trac.


=== 10/25/2009 (Week 04) ===

'''Progress:'''
 * Filled in most of the requirements doc skeleton provided on the capstone website
 * Decided to name our project RapidGraph
 * Made some decisions that cemented the overall architecture of our system
 * Decided to use JavaScript/jQuery, Django, Python, and C++ to implement our system

'''Problems:''' We were intending to set up Trac and Git this week so that we have a repo to put the work we've done so far, but we were blocked because we could not decide what our project name should be. Now that we have a name, this problem will be solved in the coming week.

'''Plans:'''
 * Set up Trac and Git, start populating Trac with tickets
 * Think about requirements and flush out any that are remaining.
 * Visualize the design of our system (Gannt chart, Use Case Diagram, Dataflow Diagram)
 * Finish filling in the requirements doc skeleton

=== 10/18/2009 (Week 03) ===

'''Progress:'''
 * Did research into project management software. Decided on Trac, as this is the industry standard.
 * Did research into versioning software. Decided on Git.
 * Talked to the powers that be at the Open Source Lab, and got free trac and Git hosting.
 * Talked with Dr. Cull regarding potential graph theory applications, and he agreed to be a resource for us as the project progresses.
 * Discussed technology options. We're thinking about Django as a framework and possibly the back-end since some of the algorithms are quite processor intensive, and client-side technology for the front end.

'''Problems:''' We had the issue of not having any kind of project management software set up yet, so ideas and plans have essentially been scribbled down on scraps of paper lying around the house.

'''Plans:'''
 * We need to talk to the OSL about server slice.
 * Actually getting the Trac instance up and running for use. Plan to do this early next week.
 * Start flushing out requirements and tickets on Trac.
